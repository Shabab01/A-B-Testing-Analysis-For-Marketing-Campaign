## Project Overview
This project is an A/B testing analysis for marketing campaign performance on two platforms: Facebook and AdWords. Key metrics such as clicks, conversions, and costs are analyzed using Python, with visualizations to demonstrate the outcomes. Time series forecasting techniques are also applied to predict future clicks and conversions.

### Key Objectives
- Perform A/B testing and hypothesis testing for campaign comparison.
- Forecast clicks and conversions over a specified period.
- Visualize insights for clear and interpretable findings.

## Features
- **A/B Testing Analysis**: Statistical analysis to test hypotheses and determine statistical significance.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Forecasting of future clicks and conversions using ARIMA models or Prophet.
- **Visualizations**: Data visualizations for trends, KPIs, and forecasting insights.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. The required libraries can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shabab01/A-B-Testing-Analysis-For-Marketing-Campaign.git
   cd A-B-Testing-Analysis-For-Marketing-Campaign
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Load the provided dataset into the notebook. Ensure the date column is in the correct format and all necessary preprocessing steps are completed.
2. **Run Analysis Cells**: Execute each cell step-by-step to view statistical analyses, time series forecasting, and visualizations.
3. **Modify Parameters**: Adjust forecasting periods or model parameters as needed to tailor the analysis to specific requirements.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required for this analysis:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`
- `statsmodels`


These can be installed directly from the `requirements.txt` file.

## Results and Insights
This notebook provides insights into:
- **Comparative Performance**: Which platform performs better in terms of clicks and conversions.
- **Statistical Significance**: Determining if the observed differences between Facebook and AdWords are statistically significant.
- **Future Trends**: Forecasting models reveal expected future performance for clicks and conversions.
